# Webifi Python Bootloader

This bootloader is used by the user to program the latest firmware on a Webifi device. The user need to download a .wfw file 
from www.webifi.me. This file will be programmed to the hardware using this script. We have a bootloader for Python 3 (WebifiBootloader3.py)
and Python 2.7 (WebifiBootloader27.py). Before running the script, update the details in settings.ini.
